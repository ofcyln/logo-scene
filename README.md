# Logo Scene - Prototype Scene Creator

## Using project 

### On live environment

The final app hosted on <a alt="Logo Scene screenshot" target="_blank" href="https://logo-scene.firebaseapp.com">https://logo-scene.firebaseapp.com</a>

### On local environment

Run these commands in the terminal to run the app on your local environment

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/logo-scene.git

    npm install

    npm start

or if you use yarn as package manager

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/logo-scene.git

    yarn

    yarn start

### Development server

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` for a dev server to initialize. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## App's Motivation
* I've created this project to see the logo of my new project on the screen with a variety of changes for example logo background color, logo brand name, brand name color, font type, font size, positions of the logo and brand name.
* You can change the logo with yours easily by replacing the logo in the 'assets/logo' folder. I suggest you to add SVG logo because everything on the screen is scalable.

## Screenshots

</a>

## Upcoming improvements
* Take a screenshot of the logo scene and save it on your local machine
* Saving the logo scene with transparent background
* Re-calculate boundaries of the screen on change of the window size
* More options to edit brand name's styles and logo scene itself
