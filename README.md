# Logo Scene - Prototype Logo Creator

### Using the project on local environment and using it on Stackblitz

Simply go to this URL: [https://stackblitz.com/github/ofcyln/logo-scene](https://stackblitz.com/github/ofcyln/logo-scene)

Stackblitz can only show you the visible UI of the project without cloning it to your local environment. Please not that, for security reasons `Stackblitz` doesn't show images, fonts or font icons that used on the project.

----------------

Run these commands in the terminal to run the app on your local environment

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/logo-scene.git

    npm install

    npm start

or if you use yarn as package manager

    git clone https://github.com/ofcyln/logo-scene.git

    yarn

    yarn start

### Development server

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` for a dev server to initialize. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## App's Motivation
*   I've created this project to see the logo of my new project on the screen with a variety of changes for example logo background color, logo brand name, brand name color, font type, font size, positions of the logo and brand name.

*   You can change the logo with yours easily by replacing the logo in the 'assets/logo' folder. I suggest you to add SVG logo because everything on the screen is scalable.

## Future improvements
*    Upload your own logo easily with an upload logo button
*    Change size of the logo on the screen
*    Take a screenshot of the logo scene with a button
*    Re-calculate boundaries of the screen on change of the window size
